# 404 Slayers: E-Commerce ETL(WIP)

Public Repository for Team Alchemy's Project Boards and Wiki

## Project Description

The purpose of the project is to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and web application to view and manipulate an E-commerce mock data set from an AWS server. We used Talend to read a CSV file with 1000 entries of mock E-commerce data with some dirty data, cleaned that data, then load it onto an AWS server where it can be accessed from the web application.
